# BRP-BetaPictoris

There are three different subdirectories. Each subdirectory has a different model, however they all have the same layout. It includes a chi squared fit, a MCMC fit and a figures module, which produces the final plot.
- The initial parameters given for the chi squared fit are given by trial and error.

Blackbody Model:
- The values of the parameters in the MCMC fit are the resulted parameter values of the Chi Squared Fit
- The values of the parameters in the Figures notebook are the values of the parameters of the MCMC Fit

One Ring Model:
- The ice and silicate files, for the outer ring, from the Chi Squared Fit (One-Ring-Model) remained fixed throughout all upcoming notebooks (Inclusing Two-Ring-Model)
- The values of the parameters in the MCMC fit are the resulted parameter values of the Chi Squared Fit (One-Ring-Model)
- The values of the parameters in the Figures notebook are the values of the parameters of the MCMC Fit (One-Ring-Model)

Two Ring Model:
- The silicate file, for the inner ring, from the Chi Squared Fit (Two-Ring-Model) remained fixed throughout all upcoming notebooks
- The values of the parameters in the MCMC fit are the resulted parameter values of the Chi Squared Fit (Two-Ring-Model)
- The values of the parameters in the Figures notebook are the values of the parameters of the MCMC Fit (Two-Ring-Model)
