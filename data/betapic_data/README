Files in the zip file:

1) chen+07_slshlh.dat
Contains the Spitzer IRS spectrum of BetaPic from ~5-35 microns. 
Columns are all labelled (wavelength in microns, flux (F_nu) and uncertainty in Janskys, (Jy)).
You'll need to convert to nu*F_nu in order to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED), 
i.e. the plot from the project page.

2) betapic_fluxes.dat
Contains assorted photometry from the optical and infrared with BetaPic. 
The input that you want is formatted as wavelength (mircons), flux (F_nu, Jy), uncertainty (Jy).
There are a lot of comment lines with notes on the magnitudes and fluxes that can 
be ignored or removed.

3) betapic_lws_cnt3_.txt
Contains the ISO LWS spectrum of BetaPic, from ~43 to 160 microns. 
NOTE: This spectrum is in a different format:
wavelength (microns), nu*F_nu (erg/cm^2/s), and uncertainty in nu*F_nu (same units).
So no conversion is necessary here.

4) Three files:
mips_sed_vb.dat
mips_sed_vb_above.dat
mips_sed_vb_below.dat

The Spitzer MIPS SED mode spectra. These have the format:
wavelength (microns), flux (Jy)

I need to go back to my reduction routine and print the error columns, but this will get you started.
