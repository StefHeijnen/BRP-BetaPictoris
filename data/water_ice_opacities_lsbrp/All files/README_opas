The opacity files have 5 columns with the following headers:

Wavelength (mic)
Total opacity
Albedo
Absorption coefficient
Asymmetry parameter g

h2oice.p3p5.amin0p005.amax1mm.g.ab0p0005.wb08c146

p3p5 => n^(-3.5) in the MRN power law distribution of dust grain sizes
amin0p005 => minimum grain size of power law distribution, in microns
amax1mm => maximum grain size of power law distribution
ab0p0005 => ice abundance, with respect to the gas (we'll have to see how to treat that)
